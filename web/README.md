# Web module

The `web` directory contains the browser client built with React and Three.js.
It connects to the local `openastrovizd` daemon over WebSockets to display
satellites on an interactive globe and play back time steps.  The code base is
TypeScript and uses Vite for development.

Return to the [project README](../README.md) for installation instructions and
more details about the overall architecture.
