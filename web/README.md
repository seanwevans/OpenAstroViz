# Web module

This directory contains the browser UI and supporting assets. The client is built with Vite and depends on Node.js and Yarn.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18** (install via `scripts/setup.sh` or from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Yarn** package manager

Run the repository setup script from the project root to install these tools automatically:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

## Getting started

Install dependencies and launch the development server:

```bash
cd web
yarn install
yarn dev
```

The site will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.
